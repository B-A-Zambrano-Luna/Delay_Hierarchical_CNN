# Hierarchical Neural Networks, p-Adic PDEs, and Applications to Image Processing

The first goal of this article is to introduce a new type of p-adic reaction–diffusion cellular neural network with delay. We study the stability of these networks and provide numerical simulations of their responses. The second goal is to provide a quick review of the state of the art of p-adic cellular neural networks and their applications to image processing.
